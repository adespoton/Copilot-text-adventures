# Copilot-text-adventures
 Text adventures generated with assistance from Copilot
echelon.py - could do with some development; a dystopian adventure modeled on recent activities and a certain novel series.  Copilot was oddly adept at creating this, after first insisting it couldn't do anything with copyrighted works or real people.  Directing it to use fan fiction for the works and riffs on public figures and then dialing those back to more align with specific individuals was all it took.

To play, run python3 echelon.py and follow the prompts.  Feel free to expand and tweak.
